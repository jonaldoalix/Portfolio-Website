# Portfolio Website

Thanks for checking out this repo! 

This is the code behind jonaldoalix.com and I'm happy to share it! 

It's been made easily customizable so that anyone can use this as a starting point and reuse most of the code to make their own modern react developer portfolio website.  

Want to see it live or contract me to adapt a version of this for yourself? Need me to build something else? Check out this repo and contact me [here!](https://jonaldoalix.com)
