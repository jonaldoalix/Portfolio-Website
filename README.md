# Portfolio Website
<div>
  <p>Thanks for checking out this repo!</p>
  <p>This is the code behind jonaldoalix.com and I'm happy to share it!</p>
  <p>It's been made easily customizable so that anyone can use this as a starting point and reuse most of the code to make their own modern react developer portfolio website.</p>
  <p>Want to see it live or contract me to adapt a version of this for yourself? Need me to build something else? Check out this repo and contact me <a href="https://jonaldoalix.com">here!</a></p>
