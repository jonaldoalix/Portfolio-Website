# Portfolio Website

Thanks for checking out this repo! 

This is the code behind jonaldoalix.com and I'm happy to share it! 

It's been made easily personalizable so that anyone can use this as a starting point and reuse most of the code to make their own modern react developer portfolio website.  

Want to see it live or contract me to adapt a version of this for yourself? Like me to build something else? Check out this repo live and contact me [here!](https://jonaldoalix.com) 


## To Personalize

Once you have a copy of the repo installed locally:
- Copy the .env.example file and name it .env.  Uncomment and populate the variables you intend to use and then save it.
- Open the portfolio.js file and modify the values in the file to customize the contents of the portfolio.
- Open the _globalColor.scss file and modify the colors as desired to make the aesthetics to your liking.
- Update the information in ./public/index.html including the title and meta data and save.
- Replace images and animations as desired to complete personalizing the portfolio.
